# WirelessViewModel: Taming the UI Complexity

## What is WirelessViewModel?

The WirelessViewModel is a powerful abstraction within our library that addresses a common challenge in Jetpack Compose applications â€“ ViewModel bloating.

## Why is it Needed?

In Compose-based applications, ViewModels play a crucial role in managing UI-related data and logic. However, as the UI grows in complexity, so does the ViewModel, often resulting in a tight coupling between Composables and specific ViewModel implementations. This can make the codebase less modular and harder to maintain.

## The Solution: Decoupled Data Management

Our WirelessViewModel offers a solution to this problem by decoupling Composables from specific ViewModel implementations. Instead of directly accessing ViewModel properties, Composables can interact with data through a flexible notification system. This approach allows you to:

- **Decouple Composables**: Composables become more modular and reusable as they're no longer tightly bound to specific ViewModels.

- **Flexibility**: Change the source of data or business logic without impacting Composables.

- **Reduce ViewModel Bloating**: Keep ViewModels focused on their core responsibilities.

- **Shared Data**: Easily share data and trigger actions between different parts of your application.

## Simplifying UI Development

With WirelessViewModel, you can streamline UI development, making your codebase more maintainable and adaptable as your application evolves.
